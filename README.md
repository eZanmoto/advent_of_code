About
-----

These are my solutions to select questions of the Advent of Code 2019.

Usage
-----

Solutions can be run using `cargo run --bin=day_<n>_<p>`, where `n` is the day
and `p` is the part. For example, to run the solution for day 3 part 2 use
`cargo run --bin=day_3_2`.

`cargo test` runs all tests.
